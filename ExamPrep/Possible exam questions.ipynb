    "**Answer** Detailed balance means every process is balanced by its counterproces. Statistical equilbrium means that sum of the rates of all processes populating level $i$ equals the sum of rates of all processes depopulating the level $i$. So, the difference is that in statistical equilbrium the *sum* of the processes considered, it does not saying anything about a process and its counterprocess."

    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Flux density has units erg s-1 cm-1 Hz-1 or Jy. Specific energy density is defined as 1 over the speed of light times the flux density. The units then become erg cm-2 Hz-1. So from a measure of energy per unit of time per unit of distance, it transforms into a unit of energy per area. This makes sense. Since energy comes in with a velocity equal to the speed of light, you have to devide by $c$ to remove the time factor and obtain the energy density per area."

For this case, we sum the radiative capture rate coefficient $\\alpha_{nl}$ overa ll levels $nl$. **Case B**: Case B is optically thick to radiation just above $I_H = 13.60 \\text{ eV}$, so that ionizing photons emitted during recombination are immediatly reabsorbed, creating another ion and free electron by photoionization. In this case, the recombinations directly to $n=1$ do not reduce the ionization of the gas: only recombinations to $n \\geq 2$ act to reduce the ionizzation."

This collision produces a spectral line that corresponds with the energy conversion."

It tells you what kind of star is there. If the luminosity of recombination lines for a whole galaxy can be measured, the formation rate of O-stars can be deduced. O-stars are short lived stars, their lifetime w.r.t long living stars can be neglected. Therefore the number of O stars in a galaxy is a measure of the star formation rate (SFR) in a galaxy. \n",

The real situation is somewhere in between these two extremes.\n",
